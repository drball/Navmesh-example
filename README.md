# Navmesh-example
Unity assets folder, an example 3D project, with an object moving towards a target using navmesh

This was created just as an experiment really, following a tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcJSz5c4VGk

Pathfinding in Unity works by using a navmesh, which works fine in 3D if you want to use the x,z axis. But not in 2D games using the x,y axis. 

This example has a target (the player I suppose), and a "Zombie", a mav mesh agent which will always move towards the target.
